I will convncei you and Stephen A 10-12E ESPN2. Also PATS -JETS, CAM-EAGLES. RG3 - COUSINS  CONTROVERSY.It is sadly stunning how little Colin Kaepernick now uses the legs with which he once terrorized defenses.49ers extremely disappointing so far. Seattle looking like Seattle again. But Seahawks are -28 in 4th quarters.Today's podcast: https://t.co/CSemO641EwStephen A and I debate Seahawks done?  Manziel and domestic violence? G HARDY vs Eli? Kevin Love over Tim Duncan? 10-12E ESPN2Sorry, Cub fans. "Back to the Future" has become back to the drawing board. But it was a memorable year and next year will be even more so.Daniel Murphy's body is now inhabited by an alien with superhuman power.Now sudden Mets fan Stephen A will be gloating. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A YANKEE FAN. No real Yankee fan would EVER root for MetsCubs 7-0 vs Mets this reg season. JHammel allowed 1 run in 8-inning start vs Mets. Now he's gone in 2nd, 4-0 Mets, who're up 3-0. Over.The Miami Heat are a serious threat to the Cavs in the East. If DWade stays reasonably healthy, they'll win it.My only issue w/ Anthony Davis as he enters 4th season: Is he That Guy? Can he lead and carry a team to a title? Or is he just stat machine?Steph won GM poll over CP3 for best point guard. AGREE. At least Steph has a ring.Anthony Davis won GM poll over LeBron for which player start team with. I'd also consider Russell Westbrook and DeMarcus Cousins.Remember, the average healing time for Dez's injury is 3 months. Even then, high risk of re-injury. Dez's surgery was 5 weeks ago.I HOPE Dez will play Sunday. I'd be shocked if he actually did. Either way, I will not be shocked if the Cowboys win.54% of GMs say Cavs will win it all. 25% say Spurs. So Cavs would easily beat Spurs in Finals? LAUGHABLY WRONG.Today's podcast: https://t.co/KrVtTiTZX7WILL DEZ PLAY AT GIANTS? Stephen A and I debate. Cavs locks to win it all? AD now best in NBA? Bills crumbling? 10-12E ESPN2That's it for the Cubs. DeGrom is tough enough to beat without beating yourselves WITH SO MANY DEFENSIVE BLUNDERS.Money Mayweather should fight Triple G ... then a healthy Pacquiao. Talk about MONEY.Hey @FloydMayweather: Golovkin called you a fake &amp; phony. Teach him a lesson! Take him to school! Another big payday! Prove Stephen A wrong!Not like Triple G is 23. He's 33! Floyd by unanimous decision! Stephen A being so disrespectful to Money Mayweather! Have some faith!Mayweather has fought at 154, Golovkin at 156. Floyd's reach: 72 inches to Triple G's 70. Floyd would fight rings around slow Triple G!SHOCKED Stephen A says Triple G would be too big/powerful for Floyd. I THOUGHT MAYWEATHER WAS GREATEST DEFENSIVE FIGHTER EVER!If Dez can play Sunday - and obviously can stay healthy - look out, NFL. If Cowboys can win couple of games before Romo returns, LOOK OUT.As impressive as Eagles D looked, how far can this team really go with Sam "Bad"ford at QB? So INT-prone.Last night was a good night for the Cowboys. Giants didn't separate from NFC E pack, both teams looked beatable, both could lose Sunday.Today's podcast: https://t.co/mdteg5cDjeWe're about to debate NFC East, Louisville scandal, outrageous Buss quotes, Golivkin-Mayweather,  Henson profiling. 10-12 E ESPN2Thank you, Eagles. Now the Dallas Cowboys remain very much afloat in the NFC East and now have more of a shot at Giants this Sunday.After what Eli did to the Eagles D on his opening TD drive, it's amazing the Giants are still stuck on seven points through three quarters.Sam Badford just gave Eli ANOTHER opportunity to get back in this game.Please, Sam Bradford, don't throw another awful momentum-killing interception. Run, Chip, run.The Eli who has led the NFL in interceptions THREE TIMES has spectacularly re-emerged in prime time.#SighEaglesSigh#FlyEaglesFlyOnly way Indy trick play makes sense is if "QB" can count defenders and throw to flank. But "QB" is backup safety! Lone blocker is WR! DUMB!Landry Jones is no Steelers savior. But Michael Vick was so bad he made Landry Jones look like Ben Roethlisberger.Starting to hear same excuse for Aaron Rodgers I hear for LeBron: HE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH HELP! Tom Brady makes average help much better.My Cowboys need the Eagles to beat the Giants tonight. Heart over head: Eagles win shootout, 31-30. (Hate having to root for Chip &amp; Riley.)Stephen A says Richard Sherman just isn't himself. Maybe he needs to feed that little voice in his stomach with more Oberto.The Patriots didn't embarrass the Colts, as so many thought they would. The Colts embarrassed themselves w/ dumbest trick play ever.Today's podcast: http://t.co/deQalA8XBZSTEPHEN A AND I ABOUT TO DEBATE PAGANO BLUNDER, BRADY'S REVENGE, CAM, VICK, PACK, MANZIEL, JETS-PATS, GIANTS-EAGLES. JOIN US 10-12E, ESPN2Love ChJones, Blount saying it was just another win, on to the Jets. Just kick their sorry butts. Say nothing. Move on.Tonight we saw for a fifth time just how much better Tom Brady is than Andrew Luck.In going all out to win this game, Chuck Pagano just might have lost his job.I said Pats by 6. They win by 7.If Malcolm Butler ever starts catching all the balls he gets his hands on ...@smileypayaly s.o.r.r.y.@smileypayaly I'm so sorry PAYALLoad. Pop. Load. Pop.

A: Their balls are just for decoration.I was the kid next door's imaginary friendWe suffer because we have forgotten that weÔøΩre all familyPickup Line: Sure its a needle but it moves like a sewing machineYou and you alone make me feel that I am aliveI knew my mother had it in for me from a young age. My bath toys were an electric toaster and hair-dryer.A kiss makes the heart young again and wipes out the yearsLearning to live in the present moment is part of the path of joyA silent prayer, like dreamers do, then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of youIt is better to be looked over than overlooked.PickUpLine: We shouldn't waste this day. What do you say we use these condoms?Fireworks, fucking in the streets, mimesÔøΩ I hope I see it somedayÔøΩSo-called irresponsible behavior vanishes & your gifted with the freedom to create a new lifeYou can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent jobPickUpLine: So, are you going to give me your phone number, or am I going to have to stalk you?PickUpLine: Would you like to screw?Of course there is not formula for success except, perhaps, an unconditional acceptance of life and what it bringsWe are here to add what we can to life, not to get what we can from lifeLove is the power to see similarity in the dissimilarWhy is there a show called "When animals attack"? It should be called "When stupid people go near dangerous animals."From the actions stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of livingA witty woman is a treasure; a witty beauty is a powerMy body actually looks like an old banana, but it's fineA man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reasonYou must also give mental and physical fitness priorityTrue beauty in a woman is reflected in her soulIf State Farm were such a good neighbor they'd come over and pick up all the dog shit in my yardMy house is so trashed that Whitney Houston just dropped by in her 1988 Ford Escort & gave me a high five & then she asked me for ten bucksLove is the delusion that one woman differs from anotherIf you're happy, if you're feeling good, then nothing else mattersIf I had a star for every scar you tattooed on my heart I could fill up the Oklahoma sky.Roadside sign holders are secretly geniuses because they get paid to do something a pole does for nothingI paint objects as I think them, not as I see themThere's a lot of people in this world who spend so much time watching their health that they haven't the time to enjoy itEveryone always talks about the early bird. How about the early worm? How'd that work out for him?Was just watching Animal Planet, and get this, hippos don't really eat marbles!Don't get lost in thought; you'll be a total stranger there.One must work and dare if one really wants to liveWhen a cop pulls you over, never start a sentence with, "This may be the alcohol talking, butOnly you, you're the only thing I'll see forever. In my eyes, in my words and in everything I do.I'm comfortable, and I know my surroundingsI sometimes go to my own little world, but that's okay, they know me there.Old enough to know better, young enough to not give a damn fuckA lion wouldn't cheat, but a tiger woodThe secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrowEncouragement is the oxygen of the soulThe problem with beauty is that it's like being born rich and getting poorerThe greatest pain that comes from love is loving someone you can never have.Our duty is to be useful, not according to our desires but according to our powersThat millisecond your sure your going to die when you lean back in your chair a little to farThe best vitamin for making friends, B-1.Enjoy Life, Give Joy, and Be at Peace!Realistically, it doesn't hurt to be good-looking, especially in this businessI long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot,  And I too sufferIntelligence is really a kind of taste: taste in ideasPeople who work over 60 hours a week have more sex on average than people who work less.To keep the body in good health is a dutyI have wished to know why the stars shineWithout humor, life is boring. Without love, life is hopeless. Without courage, life is hard.Always end the name of your child with a vowel, so that when you yell the name will carryBut when you walk into a party, you don't see somebody's brainIf God wanted us to bend over he'd put diamonds on the floorThe great art of life is sensation, to feel that we exist, even in painIf your giving isnÔøΩt free then it isnÔøΩt true loveWhy are husbands like lawn mowers? They're hard to get started, emit foul odors, and don't work half the time.Sometimes it's good to put up walls, not to keep people out, but to see who cares enough to break them down. They are the ones worth keepingPeople on Facebook "Like" everything but grammarNow and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happyO human beauty, what a dream art thou, that we should cast our life and hopes away on thee!Love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourselfLike all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truthAccept that some days you are the pigeon, and some days you are the statueGuys, always maintain eye contact when you're talking to her. It let's her know that you are only paying attention to her.Most male birds don't have a penis, but rather holes that pass the sperm to the females.My dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed - my dearest pleasure when freeSuccess is blocked by concentrating on it and planning for itWhen a thought takes one's breath away, a grammar lesson seems an impertinenceMarried men masturbate more often than married women.If you can find humor in anything, even poverty, you can survive itA positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort.If a 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?Living in good times can taste bittersweet, but it still kicks assFuck you for not including meWhat the fuck are these girls doingLmao #asstasticRT @cyberhitler: i was smoking weed while listening to spanish lessons now im rosetta stonedJust merged in the left lane on the highway and forced a car to swirve in the breakdown lane #thatwasclose #imretardedShes my draft &amp; stash #nottheNBAbutjustasriggedRT @UberFacts: Within 5 minutes of waking, half of your dream is forgotten.

- 30th anniversary of the last Royals WS title

- 29th anniversary of the last Mets WS title.@jaysonst Royals' Cain scored from 1B on a single twice this postseason. 20 players scored from 1B on RBI single in entire regular season.The Royals are the 5th American League team in the divisional era to return to the World Series the year after losing the World Series.The Royals are back in the World Series for the 2nd straight year!

They had 2 appearances total before 2014. https://t.co/9uvBsSYHZ7The Jays have only played one game on Oct. 23 previously ... and they also trailed by 1 entering the 9th then... https://t.co/SrSqC5owyvHosmer's RBI ties George Brett for most in Royals postseason history.

Both players have 23.Eric Hosmer turns 26 in 6 minutes. He now has 23 RBI in his postseason career. Only Albert Pujols had more before his 26th birthday.Memphis: 4th 50-point game this season, only Baylor (6) and TCU (5) have more.Per @Fangraphs, the Blue Jays' win probability after the Donaldson strikeout was 12.9%.

After Bautista's game-tying HR: 45.5%.

Now: 40%.Bautista becomes the 4th-oldest player in MLB postseason history to have a multi-homer game with 3 RBI.

Babe Ruth the oldest to do this.Bautista is the 1st player to hit a game-tying or go-ahead HR in the 8th inn or later of Game 6 or 7 in the ALCS since Aaron Boone in '03.Joey Bats with his 4th HR of the 2015 postseason, which sets a new single postseason HR record for Toronto.Jose Bautista is the first player in Blue Jays history to hit multiple HR in a postseason game!The Mavericks dropped to 0-7 this preseason.

They have not lost 7 straight regular season games since 1998-99, Dirk's rookie season.Memphis QB Paxton Lynch has his 2nd career 400-yard passing game! 

His Tigers lead Tulsa 49-35 on ESPN/WatchESPN: https://t.co/lqSRlkHdw1.Andrew Wiggins (MIN): game-high 24 points as well as 6 rebounds and 4 assists.

That's his most points, rebounds and assists this preseason.Derrick Rose scored 8 points in 10 minutes in his preseason debut.

Rose suffered a left orbital fracture on Sept. 29.Memphis scored 35 points in the 1st half, its most in a 1st half against an FBS school since '04.

Catch the rest: https://t.co/lqSRlkHdw1.The Canadiens have won their first 8 games of the season, all in regulation.

The only other team to do this in reg? The 1975-76 Sabres.Paxton Lynch's 289 pass yards in the 1st half are the most he's thrown for in any half of his career.Joey Bats tied the Jays' single postseason HR record with his 3rd long ball of the 2015 playoffs ... a 431-footer! https://t.co/cGZvudZHMsPaxton Lynch's 3 touchdown passes are the most he's thrown in a 1st half in 31 career starts.David Price has now allowed multiple HR in 2 starts this postseason.

He allowed multiple HR in just 2 regular season games this year.Moustakas' HR was the 6th of his postseason career, 2nd most in Royals history. 

Only George Brett with 10 has more.The Royals did not hit multiple HRs by the end of the 2nd in a ‚Äãhome‚Äã game all year.

Zobrist and Moustakas have already homered in Game 6.Ben Zobrist (KC): 2 HR in ALCS; had 2 HR in entire postseason career entering this series (26 games)Revere's hit was the first by the Jays in the 1st inning all series!Jays with leadoff doubles in postseason:
